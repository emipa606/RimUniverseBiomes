[h1]TEMPORALY NOT MAINTAINED[/h1]
As I'm working on another project, I don't have time to dedicate to this mod, also there are other mods outside doing what I wanted to do with this mod. So this one is not a priority for me at the moment. I'm still working on RimUniverse series, but will be focused on other aspects of RimWorld.


[h1]Main features[/h1]
- [b]Biomes[/b] reworked. A complete new biome tile selection simulating real life biome distribution based on Whittaker's biome diagram.
- [b]Added new biomes:[/b] Permafrost, Grassland, Savanna, Woodland and Moist Deciduous Forest.
- Rivers, lakes, marsh water and coastal water will respond to extreme low temperatures freezing the water.
