  <!-- EN: Savannas are mixed woodland/grassland ecosystems typically found between rainforests and deserts. Though savannas are more forested than grasslands, their trees are still spaced widely enough that sufficient light reaches the ground to support an unbroken layer of grasses. Despite the abundance of plants, the soil is mostly dry, and a wide variety of animals roam the area searching for food and water.\n(RimUniverse - Biomes (Continued)) -->
  <Savanna.description>稀树草原是林地/草原混合生态系统，通常位于雨林和沙漠之间。虽然稀树草原的森林覆盖率要高于草原，但树木之间的间距仍然足够大，以保证有足够的光照照射到地面，使地面上的草层连绵不绝。尽管植物丰富，但土壤大多干燥，各种动物在这里游荡，寻找食物和水源。
