# TEMPORALY NOT MAINTAINED

As I&apos;m working on another project, I don&apos;t have time to dedicate to this mod, also there are other mods outside doing what I wanted to do with this mod. So this one is not a priority for me at the moment. I&apos;m still working on RimUniverse series, but will be focused on other aspects of RimWorld.


# Main features

- **Biomes** reworked. A complete new biome tile selection simulating real life biome distribution based on Whittaker&apos;s biome diagram.
- **Added new biomes:** Permafrost, Grassland, Savanna, Woodland and Moist Deciduous Forest.
- Rivers, lakes, marsh water and coastal water will respond to extreme low temperatures freezing the water.
